##The commands used in terminal to download postgres and create a new database

##Intall Homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

##Install postgres
brew install postgres

##Open postgres
brew services start postgresql

##I used the localhost as my database and connected it to datagrip for this case-study

##If I were to create a new database to use I would have use the following code:
psql postgres -U <my_user_name>

postgres=> CREATE DATABASE <new_database_name>;

postgres=> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE super_awesome_application TO <my_user_name>;
